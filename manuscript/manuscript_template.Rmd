# you have to use the xelatex latex_engine. Also important to note, most 
# journals need Word files (or Latex) for copy editing. You can simply
# comment out lines (20, 21, 23 and 24) and uncomment the

# Abstract

1.  Ecologists often have lots of questions about lots of stuff

2.  We evaluated a bunch of things using sophisticated methods and carried out complicated statistical tests

3.  We discovered a bunch of things that we didn't already know but suspected

4.  Our research has greatly advanced out knowledge about stuff and will make a significant contribution to something and someone

**Key-words**: stuff, something

# Introduction

## And example of adding citations in RMarkdown...

Ecologists have long recognized that some combinations of species are regularly found together, while other combinations occur infrequently [@Cole:1949dz; @Elton:1946dl].

The above format wraps the citation in brackets but if you want to reference the authors by name instead of just as a citation you can use this format instead (i.e., no square brackets around the cite key)

@Cole:1949dz and @Elton:1946dl both found that blah blah blah

# Methods

To evaluate the ...

As with Pielou's Evenness [@Pielou:1967ea], Shannon's diversity index [@Shannon:1948iy]$(H)$ is normally calculated from species abundance values; however, for our purposes it is calculated from the column totals (species richness per sample) using the following equation...

$$
H_x = -S[P(i_x) \times ln(P(i_x))]
$$

where $x$ denotes which set of values we are using to calculate the index (observed, minimal or maximal), and $P(i_x)$ is the proportion of species that occur in each sample $(i)$.

The above demonstrates both "inline" and "display" math formats. If you look at the Source version you will see that it is simply the number of \$ symbols before and after that differentiates between the two. An excellent (and simple) guide on inserting math into your R Markdown documents can be found here:\
<https://rpruim.github.io/s341/S19/from-class/MathinRmd.html>

Statistical analyses were carried out in R 3.4.0 (R Core Team 2017). All code along with the simulation algorithms used are available on Zenodo / GitHub <https://link_to_archived_release_or_GitHub.com>.

# Tables

**Table 1.** Mean body mass of penguins on different islands over time.

Note: for the word version the `kable` does not output correctly. You could try using `flextable` package instead: <https://taehoonh.me/content/post/alternative-to-kable-function-when-knitting-to-ms-word.html>

```{r table_01, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, include=FALSE, paged.print=TRUE}
penguin_sum <- penguins %>%
  group_by(island, year) %>%
  summarize(mean_body_mass_g = mean(body_mass_g, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
  ungroup()

kable(x = penguin_sum, 
      col.names = c("Island", "Year", "Mean Body Mass (g)")) %>%
  kable_styling(latex_options = "hold_position") 
# without the "hold_position" the table ends up at the top of the page

```

# Figure Captions

**Figure 1**. Pretty coloured dots about penguins

# Figures

Figure 1.

```{r figure_02, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
penguins %>%
  select(species, body_mass_g, ends_with("_mm")) %>% 
  GGally::ggpairs(aes(color = species),
          columns = c("flipper_length_mm", "body_mass_g", 
                      "bill_length_mm", "bill_depth_mm")) +
  scale_colour_manual(values = c("darkorange","purple","cyan4")) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("darkorange","purple","cyan4"))

Figure 3.

```{r file="../scripts/figure_03.R"}
# this code chunk calls an external script to generate the plot. If you
# want to load or run code not for a plot you could also use the following.
# Note that it does not seem to work for plots.
# source("../scripts/figure_03.R", local = knitr::knit_global())
```

# Appendices

```{=html}
<!-- You might want to look into Bookdown if you want to do anything fancier
with your manuscript. Bookdown allows for automatic Table and Figure numbering
as well as cross referencing. That is you can create links between 'Fig 1' in
your manuscript that links to the actual figure and automatically the
the figure number as you add or remove them from the document.

I add this here because Appendices can require special handling by some 
journals and Bookdown might allow you to do that automagically -->
