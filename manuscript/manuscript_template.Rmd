# This sets up the format to match most journal requirements of 1" margins
# and 12pt Times new Roman font. The catch is that to specify the font
# you have to use xelatex latex_engine. Also important to note, most journals

# Abstract

1.  Ecologists often have lots of questions about lots of stuff

2.  We evaluated a bunch of things using sophisticated methods and carried out complicated statistical tests

3.  We discovered a bunch of things that we didn't already know but suspected

4.  Our research has greatly advanced out knowledge about stuff and will make a significant contribution to something and someone

**Key-words**: stuff, something

# Introduction

Ecologists have long recognized that some combinations of species are regularly found together, while other combinations occur infrequently [@Cole:1949dz; @Elton:1946dl]. This format wraps the citation in brackets but if you want to reference the authors by name instead of just as a citation you can use this format instead (i.e., no square brackets around the cite key)

@Cole:1949dz and @Elton:1946dl both found that

# Methods

To evaluate the ...

As with Pielou's Evenness [@Pielou:1967ea], Shannon's diversity index [@Shannon:1948iy]$(H)$ is normally calculated from species abundance values; however, for our purposes it is calculated from the column totals (species richness per sample) using the following equation...

$$
H_x = -S[P(i_x) \times ln(P(i_x))]
$$

where $x$ denotes which set of values we are using to calculate the index (observed, minimal or maximal), and $P(i_x)$ is the proportion of species that occur in each sample $(i)$.

The above demonstrates both "inline" and "display" math formats. If you look at the Source version you will see that it is simply the number of \$ symbols before and after that differentiates between the two. An excellent (and simple) guide on inserting math into your R Markdown documents can be found here:\
<https://rpruim.github.io/s341/S19/from-class/MathinRmd.html>

Statistical analyses were carried out in R 3.4.0 (R Core Team 2017). All code along with the simulation algorithms used are available on Zenodo / GitHub <https://link_to_archived_release_or_GitHub.com>.
